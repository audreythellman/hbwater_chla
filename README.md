# HBWaTER choropyll-a processing for algae data
Converting chlorophyll-a measurements in raw florescence units (rfu) to mg/m<sup>2</sup>

This repository is for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) long-term stream ecology record: Algae (2018-present). 

If you are calculating from rfu to mg/m<sup>2</sup>, please see the [vignette](https://github.com/audreythellman/hbwater_chla/blob/master/rfu-calculation-vignette.md) on how to process the files 

The demo data folder has template data for formatting purposes.
